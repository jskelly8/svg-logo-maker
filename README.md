## Description

Challenge 10 -- SVG Logo Maker

This project was built so that a user can easily create a new basic logo for anything by simply answering just 4 questions. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and saves the generated SVG to a `.svg` file. Throughout building this project, I solidified my knowledge in using Node JS & Inquirer, and learned more about jest testing, svg files, and OOP (especially classes).

## Tests

You can freely test this application by first having the dependencies installed, open your terminal, type `npm run test` and hit enter, which will run my written jest testing (file: shapes.test.js).

You can also test this application by opening your terminal, type `npm run start` then simply answer the questions as they appear. Once all questions are done, a svg file called 'logo.svg' will be placed inside the examples folder. You can then either save that file, or image, or you can `npm run start` again and start over, generating a new logo in its place.
